# Show top 10 articles from Hacker News

> This repository is the companion to the ["Show top 10 articles from Hacker News"](https://reactpractice.dev/exercise/show-top-10-articles-from-hacker-news/) practice exercise.

Build a React component that shows a list of 10 articles from the Hacker News API.

- use the Hacker News "Top Articles" API \*
- for each article, display its score, title, url and author
- do not display the article details until all the data is loaded

\* you'll notice I did not include a link to the API - this is on purpose! Looking up the API documentation and figuring out what endpoint to use is part of the challenge.

To get started, you can clone this starter repo.
